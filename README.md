# checksum

Attempt to explore the StrongPath library, and recurisvely print checksums of all files starting in some directory. Does not do robust error checking. Likely various idiomatic Haskell improvements available (including removing some duplicative boilerplate for file vs dir). :)

`stack build`

`stack run "/Users/shayne/dev/foo"`
